# Korg Volca Sample Helper

Upload samples the Korg Volca Sample easily with this little app. Run it on a computer attached to the Volca Sample 'sync in' socket. Drag samples to the slots to upload, click to audition the file, long-click to download to the sampler.

Uses the [Korg Syro example app](http://korginc.github.io/volcasample/) to encode the audio to Volca Sample-compatible audio.
